    <p>
      This website is a collection of design work. A personal space or archive of
       work that I find to be notable, or has inspired me for my personal projects either it
      be web design, pieces of writing, publishing/print design or film. The idea is to
      embrace the whole of Design.

    <p>
      I wanted to create a space which I can add my thoughts too, done through the notes I have made throughout.
      Hand writing them  making sure to emphasize that they are my thoughts. Few other elements are also
      handwritten. This added a textural and personal quality to the otherwise clean and simple visuals, which I enjoy in design itself,
      and wanted to incorporate here.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's a collection that can be updated, added to or edited. Therefore, becomes a site that is
      supposed to be an ongoing accumulation of design work. For others to view, take inpspiration from,
      or just see my take/thoughts on the work.
