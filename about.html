    <p>
      This website is a collection of design work. A personal space and archive of
       work that I find to be notable, or has inspired me for my personal projects. Either it
      be web design, pieces of writing, publishing/print design or film. The idea is to
      embrace the whole of design.

    </p>

    <p>
      I wanted to create a space where I can add my thoughts to, done through the notes and captions I have made throughout.
      I emphasize these thoughts using handwriting along with a few other elements which are also handwritten.
      This added a textural and personal quality to the otherwise clean and simple visuals, which I enjoy in design itself,
      and wanted to incorporate here.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's a collection that can be updated, added to or edited. Therefore, becomes a site that is
      supposed to be an ongoing accumulation of design work. Even though it's a personal
      space it's also for others to view, take inpspiration from,
      or just see my take on the work.
