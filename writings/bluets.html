<p> <i> a few excerpts </i> </p>

<p>1. Suppose I were to begin by saying that I had fallen in love with a color. Suppose I were to speak this as though it were a confession; suppose I shredded my napkin as we spoke. It began slowly. An appreciation, an affinity. Then, one day, it became more serious. Then (looking into an empty teacup, its bottom stained with thin brown excrement coiled into the shape of a sea horse) it became somehow personal.</p>

<p>2. And so, I fell in love with a color—in this case, the color blue—as if falling under a spell, a spell I fought to stay under and get out from under, in turns.</p>

<p>14. I have enjoyed telling people that I am writing a book
about blue without actually doing it. Mosty what happens in such cases is that people give you stories or leads
or gifts, and then you can play with these things instead of with words. Over the past decade I have been given blue inks, paintings, postcards, dyes, bracelets, rocks, precious stones, watercolors, pigments, paperweights,
goblets, and candies. I have been introduced to a man who had one of his front teeth replaced with lapis lazuli, solely because he loved the stone, and to another who
worships blue so devoudy that he refuses to eat blue food and grows only blue and white flowers in his garden, which surrounds the blue ex-cathedral in which he lives. I have met a man who is the primary grower of organic indigo
in the world, and another who sings Joni Mitchell’s Blue in heartbreaking drag, and another with the face of a derelict whose eyes literally leaked blue, and I called this one the prince of blue, which was, in fact, his name. </p>


<p>15. I think of these people as my blue correspondents,

whose job it is to send me blue reports from the field.</p>


<p>51. You might as well act as if objects had the colors, The Encyclopedia says. –Well, it is as you please. But what would it look like to act otherwise?</p>

<p>71. I have been trying, for some time now, to find dignity in my loneliness. I have been finding this hard to do. </p>



<p> 72. It is easier, of course, to find dignity in one’s solitude. Loneliness is solitude with a problem. Can blue solve the
problem, or can it at least keep me company within it? —No, not exactly, It cannot love me that way; it has no
arms. But sometimes I do feel its presence to be a sort of wink—Here you are again, it says, and so am I.</p>

  <p>
    156. Why is the sky blue? -A fair enough question, and one I have learned the answer to several times. Yet every time I try to explain it to someone or remember it to myself, it eludes me. Now I like to remember the question alone, as it reminds me that my mind is essentially a sieve, that I am mortal.
  </p>

  <p>
    157. The part I do remember: that the blue of the sky depends on the darkness of empty space behind it. As one optics journal puts it, "The color of any planetary atmosphere viewed against the black of space and illuminated by a sunlike star will also be blue." In which case blue is something of an ecstatic accident produced by void and fire.
  </p>

  <p>229. I am writing all this down in blue ink, so as to remember that all words, not just some, are written in water.</p>
